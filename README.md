#### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future? ####
Following best coding practices by utilizing functions, properly naming variables, and producing well commented code creates a program that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. This was especially important when developing the CRUD Python module which serves as the "Glue" level of the this multi-tiered application. The module is responsible for the basic functionality of the program that communicates the data from the MongoDB database to the user's dashboard interface. The module's readability not only allowed me to easily identify what function is needed to call from the python web application to retreive all data from MongoDB, but in future use if I wish to expand upon the program to give the user more functionaility, I can easily identify which functions to call for updating ,removing , or updating entries which in turn makes the progam adaptable. Likewise, the maintainability of the program is displayed during troubleshooting issues. It is simple to understand, maintain, and reuse a program that can be tested by sections because it is more effecient to search and find errors. As a result, the CRUD Python module is a versitle CRUD python class with a testing script that could be instantiated to perform in different projects to connect a database to an interface.
#### How do you approach a problem as a computer sscientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests? ####
#### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better? ####
